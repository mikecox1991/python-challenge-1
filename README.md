Hello Traveler,

Welcome to my first ever program adding extra code. This will be a detailed run throughof why 
I did this and that. The problem was using a pre-built menu and taking items on that menu and 
hold those values, and print a reciept with totals. This is my first time coding please consider 
that I just made it work. 

Before you read my code I always add my initials, and date updated. This is curosity in my 
field so you can call the programmer and get help if you need it. Always helps leaving a name
and date. 

The first part of the code opens with which menu would you like to see. Click the number and it 
will take you into a sub-menu and show the items on the terminal.

if you decide that I would not like to purchase anything, there is a thank you prompt. From there 
sub-menu of items will open and you can select your items. 

For any reason you do not like the menu choices you can press enter and go back to the previous menu.

You can add as many items as you like, once you are finished you can press "q" to quit and a the prompt 
will ask name for the order, then once you enter your name a printed reciept will print, with your name 
also will have your items, quantity, sub total and total at the bottom. 

Like I said before this is my first ever coding project, and coding project using another persons code.
I know it could be better but this is what I could do. Thank you and hope you enjoy your items!
