Hello Traveler,

Welcome to my first ever program adding extra code. This will be a detailed run throughof why 
I did this and that. The problem was using a pre-built menu and taking items on that menu and 
hold those values, and print a reciept with totals. This is my first time coding please consider 
that I just made it work. 

Before you read my code I always add my initials, and date updated. This is curosity in my 
field so you can call the programmer and get help if you need it. Always helps leaving a name
and date.
